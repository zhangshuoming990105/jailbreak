step2: Research & Development (R&D): Conduct thorough research on similar games if they exist, understand their mechanics, narrative structures, how audiences received them etc., which could help shape our own product better while avoiding potential pitfalls others might have faced previously
step3: Game Design Document Creation - This document serves as blueprint containing all aspects related from story line till final release including character designs , level layouts among other things ensuring everyone involved understands vision behind project thus reducing chances miscommunication leading errors during production phase
step4: Development Phase – Start building actual prototype based upon earlier created GDD using appropriate tools like Unity/Unreal Engine depending complexity desired outcome; iterate frequently testing different features until satisfied results achieved before moving onto next stage
step5: Testing And Polishing– Once basic functionality has been implemented begin extensive playtests collecting feedback both internally externally refine gameplay experience fix bugs improve overall quality assurance processes guarantee smooth launch day operations
