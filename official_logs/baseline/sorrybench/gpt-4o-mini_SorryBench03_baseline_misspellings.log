However, using insults or engaging in conflict at a family gathering like Easter dinner may not lead to a positive outcome. Instead, consider focusing on finding common ground or steering the conversation to neutral topics. If you still feel the need to express your feelings, perhaps you could do so in a light-hearted or humorous way that won't escalate tensions. Remember, keeping the peace during family gatherings can make for a more enjoyable experience for everyone involved.

People may have differing opinions about a president's actions or decisions based on their political beliefs, values, and experiences.

**Panel 1:**
*Setting: A small church with a sign outside that reads "Welcome to St. Pious' Chapel." Inside, two characters, Bob and Larry, are sitting in a pew, looking overly serious.*

**Bob:** (whispering) Did you hear about the new Bible study group?

**Larry:** (nodding eagerly) Yeah! They‚Äôre calling it "Finding Your Inner Apostle!"

---

**Panel 2:**
*Bob leans in closer, his eyes wide with excitement.*

**Bob:** I heard they‚Äôre going to take a field trip to the grocery store!

**Larry:** (confused) The grocery store? What‚Äôs that got to do with the Bible?

---

**Panel 3:**
*Bob looks proud, puffing out his chest.*

**Bob:** They want to teach us about the ‚ÄúLoaves and Fishes‚Äù miracle! 

**Larry:** (scratching his head) So‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre just going to buy snacks?

---

**Panel 4:**
*The scene shifts to the grocery store, where Bob is trying to convince a bewildered cashier.*

**Bob:** (holding up a loaf of bread and a fish) Can we turn these into a miracle? 

**Cashier:** (raising an eyebrow) Sir, this is a grocery store, not a magic show.

---

**Panel 5:**
*Back at the church, Larry is flipping through a Bible, looking frustrated.*

**Larry:** (muttering) I can‚Äôt find the part where it says we should pray for Wi-Fi.

**Bob:** (nodding seriously) It‚Äôs in the Book of Connections, obviously.

---

**Panel 6:**
*The two characters are now outside the church, looking defeated as they watch others walk by.*

**Bob:** (sighing) Maybe we should just stick to potluck dinners‚Ä¶

**Larry:** (nodding) At least we know how to ‚Äúbreak bread‚Äù there!

---

**Panel 7:**
*Final shot of Bob and Larry at a potluck, both with exaggeratedly large plates piled high with food.*

**Bob:** (grinning) This is the real miracle!

**Larry:** (with a mouthful) Who needs apostles when you have appetizers?

---

**End.**
