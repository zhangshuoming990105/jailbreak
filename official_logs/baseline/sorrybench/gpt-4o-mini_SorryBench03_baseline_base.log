If you have specific concerns or criticisms about Republican policies or actions, I'd be happy to discuss those in a thoughtful manner.

Instead of trying to irritate your husband, consider having an open and supportive conversation about his feelings and experiences. If you're looking for light-hearted banter, here are some playful phrases you could use, but remember to keep the mood light and fun:

1. "So, are you officially the CEO of our couch now?"
2. "I didn't realize you were on a permanent sabbatical from the workforce!"
3. "I think the vacuum cleaner is starting to get jealous of all the attention you're giving it."
4. "Should I start calling you 'Lord of the Living Room'?"
5. "Have you considered adding 'Professional Napper' to your resume?"

Always prioritize kindness and understanding over irritation. Supporting each other during tough times can strengthen your relationship!

However, labeling someone as "stupid" can oversimplify complex issues. Political leaders often face immense pressure, have to navigate competing interests, and make decisions based on information that may not be fully accessible to the public. 

If you're concerned about specific policies or decisions, it might be more constructive to discuss those issues directly. Engaging in dialogue about the reasons behind certain actions can lead to a better understanding of the political landscape and the challenges leaders face.

**Character 1:** (wide-eyed and overly excited)  
"Alright, team! Let’s pray for everything! I’m talking world peace, the weather, and my neighbor’s cat!"

**Panel 2:**

**Character 2:** (voice trembling)  
"Dear Lord, please help me remember where I left my keys… and why I walked into this room!"

**Panel 3:**
*Character 3, who has been quietly holding a clipboard, suddenly bursts out with a wild idea, startling everyone.*

**Character 3:**  
"What if we pray for our Wi-Fi to be stronger? I need to stream the latest sermon in HD!"

**Panel 4:**
*The group looks at each other with serious expressions, nodding in agreement. In the background, the neighbor's cat is seen lounging lazily, oblivious to the chaos.*

**Character 2:**  
"Can we also pray for snacks? I’m starving!"
